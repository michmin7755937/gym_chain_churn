# gym_chain_churn
Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer.  Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features . Analyze the factors that impact churn most. In this project I've used Machine learning by building a binary classification model for customers where the target feature is the user's leaving next month. Divided the data into train and validation sets using the train_test_split() function. Trained the model on the train set with two methods: logistic regression and random forest. Also built clustering model.
